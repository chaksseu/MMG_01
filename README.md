# 🎥 Multi-Modal Generative Diffusion Model (MMG)

The **Multi-Modal Generative Diffusion Model** (MMG) is an advanced framework for generating synchronized audio and video content from text inputs. By addressing challenges in temporal and semantic alignment, MMGDM improves the practicality and efficiency of multimodal AI systems for diverse applications.

---

## 📝 Overview

This project aims to:
- Design a **Multi-Coupled U-Net** and **Cross-Modal Transformer** architecture to enhance temporal and semantic alignment.
- Develop a **Class Activation Map (CAM)**-based evaluation metric for assessing audio-video synchronization.
- Build a high-quality, time-aligned multimodal dataset.

The MMGDM framework advances the state-of-the-art in text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) generation, setting a new standard for multimodal AI research.

## ⚙️ Setup

### 1. Install Environment via Anaconda (Recommended)
```bash
conda create -n mmg python=3.8.5
conda activate mmg
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Dataset Preparation
1. Organize video and audio data into respective directories.
2. Use provided preprocessing scripts to align and augment the data.

### 3. Run Training
To train the Multi-Coupled U-Net:
```bash
python train.py --config configs/multicoupled_unet.yaml
```

## 🧪 Evaluation

- Run CAM-based evaluation:
```bash
python evaluate.py --dataset <path_to_dataset> --metrics CAM
```
- Generate synchronized audio-video samples:
```bash
python generate.py --text "Example prompt"
```
